<h2>Probability Distribution [6]:</h2>
This application consist of Probability Distribution , once the application is executed. Load the drink.csv file and the person can easily have the following distribution on any of the value given on the csv file.

**Binomial Distribution**
Binomial Distribution shows frequency distribution of the possible number of successful outcomes in a given number of trials in each of which there is the same probability of success.

**Normal Distribution**
A normal distribution is an arrangement of a data set in which most values cluster in the middle of the range and the rest taper off symmetrically toward either extreme.

**Poisson Distribution**
The Poisson distribution can be used to calculate the probabilities of various numbers of success based on the mean number of successes.
