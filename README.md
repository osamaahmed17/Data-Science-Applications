Binomial Distribution
Binomial Distribution shows frequency distribution of the possible number of successful outcomes in a given number of trials in each of which there is the same probability of success.

Normal Distribution
A normal distribution is an arrangement of a data set in which most values cluster in the middle of the range and the rest taper off symmetrically toward either extreme.

Poisson Distribution
The Poisson distribution can be used to calculate the probabilities of various numbers of success based on the mean number of successes.
